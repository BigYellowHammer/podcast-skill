Listen to episodes of your favourite podcasts

## About
With this skill, you can add your favorite podcasts an
Select your favourite podcasts  and listen to episodes from those podcasts. You can also check with Mycroft if there are any new episodes available from your chosen podcasts.

You can now also scroll through all episodes of your chosen podcasts.

## Setup

You can enter your chosen podcasts into the Skills Settings section of the [Mycroft Home](home.mycroft.ai) site. Here you have space to store 3 podcasts. For each one you need to enter a trigger word and the feed url for the podcast.

The trigger word can be a word of your choice that will usually be just the name of the podcast (If the podcast has an unusual name like "The Nerdist" that Mycroft nay have difficulties understanding, you can change the trigger word to something clearer like "Nerd").
The feed url is a url that can usually be found on the podcasts website under the RSS logo.
I have included some example feeds but you can change these out to the podcasts that you would like to have!

## Examples
* "play the podcast linux unplugged"
* "check for new episodes"
* "put on the podcast linux unplugged"
* "what is the latest episode of late night linux?"
