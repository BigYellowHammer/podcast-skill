# Mycroft Podcast Skill

This skill allows you to listen to episodes of your favourite podcast

## Usage
* `play the latest episode of the startup podcast`
* `play the gimlet podcast reply all`
* `play an episode of the art of manliness podcast`

## Current state

Working features:
 - Listen to the latest episode of your chosen podcast
 - Use the settings in the home.mycroft.ai site to choose 3 podcasts

Known issues:
 - Only tested on a Mark 1
 - Not sure how this skill co-operates with other podcast skills

TODO:
 - Select an older podcast, not just the most recent one
 - Ask Mycroft if there are any new episodes released of your podcasts
 - Add compatibility for a wider range of podcasts, some feeds dont work with the current implementation
